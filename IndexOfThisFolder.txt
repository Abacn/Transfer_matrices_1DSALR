* Pfunction_isobaric_*.m:
	Calculating the isothermal-isobaric partition functions of the 1D microphase former model. The suffix means—-
	HS - hard spheres. This case has analytical formula.
	NN - Nearest neighbor interaction counted. Also has analytical form.
	NNN - Next nearest neighbor counted. Transfer matrix method applied.
	3NN - Next next nearest neighbor counted. Extend the NNN transfer matrix into a larger one.

* potential.m:
	potential(r, coeffs) - return the potential of given distance and coefficients. Function been used in various files.

* boltzmanweight.m(r, bcoeffs) - return the Boltzmann weight exp(-beta*u) instead of u. the difference of bcoeffs and coeffs is that bcoeffs=[sigma, lambda, kappa, beta*epsilon, xi]

* calcentropy.m
	Calculating the entropy, as well as heat capacity Cv and Cp.
	Output: data_S/*.txt

* calcrho.m
	Calculating density with given list of temperature (beta), list of pressure in given coefficients. Output the raw data in .mat files ( for plotting usage).
	Output: data/*.mat

* deriv.m / deriv2.m / deriv2s.m
	Numerical differentiation;
	Second order numerical differentiation, and
	Second order multi variable differentiation.

* findp.m
	Find system pressure with given density. Implemented binary search to find the result.

* lowercaccu_calcrho.m
	Do the same thing as calcrho.m. Instead, use central-2 algorithm in numerical differentiation. This is adequate in data range of normal pressures. Output the raw data in .mat files (for plotting usage).

	Output: data_low/*.dat

* minsearcher.m
	Search the minimum of thermodynamic integration function h(T, rho). Given a list of temperatures, with given coefficients.
	Output: data_min/*.dat
	The data will be processing by python scripts plotmin.py


=== onetimeScripts Folder ===
	This folder includes some quick scripts that is not time consuming, and obtain small amount of data
	** secondB.m; thirdB.m
		—— Directly calculating second and third virial coefficients.
	** fourthB.m
		—— Directly calculating the fourth virial coefficent. But doesn’t walk by now.
	** criticalT_thirdB.m
		—— Automatically find the critical temperature respecting to the sign changing of third virial coefficient.
	** draw_critical.m
		—— Plotting the temperature - (cmc) critical micelle concentration. Data from pyout/rhoc-*.dat, which is generated by plotmin.py using "raw" option.
	** draw_ecmc_distribution.m
		—— Plotting the cluster size distribution. Data from ecmc simulations.
	** draw_rho_h.m
		—— Draw h(rho). Data from data_min folder, calculated by minsearcher.m
	** drawcomparison.m
		—— Comparing 
	** listBs.m
		—— For printing the B2 and B3 data with given coefficients and list of temperatures. Output to data_Bs/*.dat
	** listTc_fromB3.m
		—— Invoking criticalT_thirdB.m. Given list of coefficient xi, searching temperature range, and other coefficients fixed. Printing the result at data_Bs/Tc_*.dat. Notice that filenames only have 4 coefficients here because xi is variable.
	** drawcomparison.m
		—— draw comparison between calculation and simulation.
	** drawdifferentaccuracy.m
		—— Draw plots to compare the equation of states given by hardSphere, NN, NNN, 3NN.
	** drawpotential.m
		demonstrate the potential function.
		

== Python Codes==
* plotmin.py
	Plot the crossover at low densities, considered as (cmc) critical micelle concentration. Multiple options. See help information of this script.

==General data naming rules==

Coefficents [sigma, lambda, kappa, epsilon, xi], the corresponding data file is “sigma_lambda_kappa_epsilon_xi.dat”. If the calculation proceeded more than one time (for example, in different temperature range), the problem generate *_1.dat, *_2.dat and so on.
